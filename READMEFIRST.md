## About Clyde

Woof woof! I’m Clyde, a purebred Labrador Retriever, born on April 16, 2024. I weigh 30 lbs—a perfect size for cuddling and playing! I’m all about love and fun, with a big personality to match.

- **Who I Am**: I’m friendly, energetic, and super affectionate. I bark at squirrels and love to alert with my paw—I’m great at sniffing out anything interesting!
- **What I Love**: Chasing balls is my favorite! I also enjoy morning walks at 7 AM, playing fetch, and learning new tricks like sit and stay.
- **My Routine**: I go for walks every morning at 7 AM, and I love my routine of playing and napping throughout the day.
- **My Training**: I know commands like sit, stay, and fetch—my human says I’m a quick learner!
- **My Quirks**: I bark at squirrels every chance I get—it’s my favorite pastime!
